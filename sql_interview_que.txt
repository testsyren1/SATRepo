Q1. What is SQL, and what are its main components?
A1: SQL stands for Structured Query Language, and it is a programming language used for managing relational databases. The main components of SQL are Data Definition Language (DDL), Data Manipulation Language (DML), Data Control Language (DCL), and Transaction Control Language (TCL).


Q2. What is the difference between SQL and MySQL?
A2: SQL is a language used to interact with databases, while MySQL is a relational database management system (RDBMS) that uses SQL as its language.


Q3. Explain the different types of SQL joins.
A3: The different types of SQL joins are:

INNER JOIN: Returns records that have matching values in both tables.
LEFT JOIN: Returns all records from the left table and the matching records from the right table.
RIGHT JOIN: Returns all records from the right table and the matching records from the left table.
FULL JOIN: Returns all records when there is a match in either the left or right table.
CROSS JOIN: Returns the Cartesian product of both tables.


Q4. What is the difference between WHERE and HAVING clauses in SQL?
A4: The WHERE clause is used to filter rows before grouping or aggregation, whereas the HAVING clause is used to filter groups or aggregated data after grouping has been done.


Q5. How can you eliminate duplicate rows from a result set in SQL?
A5: Duplicate rows can be eliminated using the DISTINCT keyword or by using the GROUP BY clause to group the data based on certain columns.


Q6. What is the difference between UNION and UNION ALL in SQL?
A6: UNION combines the result sets of two or more SELECT statements, eliminating duplicate rows, while UNION ALL combines the result sets without removing duplicates.


Q7. What is the purpose of the GROUP BY clause in SQL?
A7: The GROUP BY clause is used to group rows based on one or more columns. It is often used with aggregate functions to perform calculations on each group.


Q8. Explain the ACID properties in the context of database transactions.
A8: ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability. It is a set of properties that guarantee reliable processing of database transactions. Atomicity ensures that a transaction is treated as a single, indivisible unit of work. Consistency ensures that a transaction brings the database from one valid state to another. Isolation ensures that concurrent transactions do not interfere with each other. Durability ensures that once a transaction is committed, its changes are permanent and will survive any subsequent system failures.


Q9. What are indexes in SQL, and why are they important?
A9: Indexes are database objects used to improve the performance of queries by allowing faster data retrieval. They are created on one or more columns of a table and help in quick data lookup and sorting.

Q10. How can you optimize the performance of an SQL query?
A10: Some ways to optimize the performance of an SQL query include:

a. Properly indexing the tables.
b. Writing efficient and selective WHERE clauses.
c. Limiting the columns returned in the SELECT statement.
d. Avoiding the use of SELECT *.
e. Using appropriate joins.
f. Optimizing subqueries and avoiding unnecessary nesting.
g. Analyzing and optimizing query execution plans.
h. Using appropriate data types and avoiding excessive data conversions.

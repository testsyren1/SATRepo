Project Task: ----------
Create a data integration workflow to extract data from a CSV file, perform basic transformations, and load the data into a target database table.

Requirements:----------

Extract data from a CSV file named "Sales.csv" that contains information about sales transactions.
Perform basic data cleaning by removing any empty rows or rows with missing values.
Transform the data by adding a new calculated field called "TotalSales" that multiplies the "Quantity" and "UnitPrice" columns.
